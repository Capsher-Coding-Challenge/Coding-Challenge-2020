# Capsher Technology 2020 ACC Coding Challenge

Welcome to Capsher Technology's 2020 ACC Coding Challenge!

Our challenge to you is to create a Discord Bot! That's it. You get to decide what this bot will do and how you want to develop it. All that we ask is that you create something novel and useful.

## Getting Started
There are a couple of things you need to do before writing your first line of code for this challenge.
1. Register for our challenge
    1. You can sign-up in teams of up to 4 people
1. Sign-up for a GitHub account
    1. As part of your submission you'll need to submit a link to your GitHub Repository so we can check out your source code
    1. Even if you won't be hosting the project repository, you'll probably want collaboration access for the repo
    1. You'll also need to download git (the program) so that you can use GitHub
1. Sign-up for a Discord account
    1. We'll be posting notifications for our challenge on our Discord channel

## Requirements For Submission
1. User Documentation
    1. Describe how your bot solves a problem (i.e. Problem Statement)
    1. Describe how a user would utilize your bot (i.e. Product Overview & User Commands)
1. Technical Documentation
    1. Provide an architectural overview of how your app works
        1. Detail major system components and how they communicate with each other
    1. Detail any integrated technologies and how your app uses them
        1. Libraries
        1. APIs
        1. Hosting services
1. GitHub Repository Link
    1. Submissions should include a GitHub repository link so we can reference your source code and documentation
1. Students will need to host their bot code on a server so that bots can be added to a Capsher Discord Server and be used from there

## Sample Bot
We've included some bots in python to get you started with understanding the general pattern of how a bot should work. See the SampleBots directory.

SimpleBot.py is a basic bot template for python that shows how to define a command and send a response back. (It's Pokemon themed.)

If you prefer a different language, here are some links to other GitHub repositories that have sample bots for their discord libraries. You can find the whole list of available libraries for Discord here: https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/topics/community-resources
